# DENR

DENR is a local commerce platform inspired by Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, OfferUp, and, to a lesser extent, eBay. Unlike those platforms, DENR is **purely local**—there are **no shipping options**. Users buy and sell used goods directly, face-to-face, within their own communities. However, DENR stands out in several key ways:

-  **Subscription-based platform**
-  **Invite-only access**
-  **Strictly local (no shipping)**
-  **Ad-free and revenue-sharing**
-  **Gamified good behavior**
-  **Bridges the gap between user and storefront**
-  **Community-powered commerce**

## Features

### 1. Subscription-Based Platform

DENR is **entirely subscription-based**. There is no free tier, and DENR will never serve ads or misuse user data. Subscription tiers:

| Tier                | Price (per month) | Features                                                                                   |
|---------------------|:------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Basic               | $1.00             | List and buy items, create a profile, communicate with users, manage your transactions     |
| Storefront (Den)    | $5.00             | All Basic features, plus own a permanent storefront ("den") that appears in relevant search|
| Community Leader    | $10.00            | All above features, plus den-creation tools and access to revenue-sharing                  |

-  **No commissions** on sales.  
-  **No ads**.  
-  **No extra costs** beyond the subscription tiers.

### 2. Invite-Only Platform

DENR uses a phased, invite-only system to grow its community:

1. **Phase 1:** Initial users are hand-picked friends/associates (paid contractors) with founder status and free lifetime use.
2. **Phase 2:** Select applicants from other platforms are invited after a vetting process. These users get founder badges and a trial, then pay for membership.
3. **Phase 3:** Invited users from prior phases get one invite per day (compounding) to bring in new members, who also pay after a trial.
4. **Phase 4:** Invitation restrictions are lifted, but all new users must still be approved.

This approach ensures a **community-driven, high-trust marketplace**.

### 3. Local-Only

DENR is committed to **local-only commerce**. No shipping options will be added. The platform is designed for face-to-face transactions, keeping commerce community-focused.

---

### 4. Ad-Free and Revenue-Sharing

DENR will **never serve ads**. Instead, it shares revenue:

-  **25%** of monthly subscription funds go to the developer (with plans to reduce this as the platform grows).
-  **75%** is distributed to Phase 1, Phase 2, and community leader users.

This incentivizes users to invite trustworthy buyers/sellers, maintain good standing, and actively use the platform.

### 5. Gamified Good Behavior

DENR encourages positive interactions by **gamifying customer service**:

-  Each user has an experience bar.
-  Actions like answering messages, selling/buying items, rating listings/dens, reviewing transactions, reporting poor behavior, and maintaining subscription status all affect user level/status.
-  Visual indicators show a user’s reputation and standing.

---

### 6. Bridging the Gap: User & Storefront

Users can open a **permanent storefront ("den")**:

-  Storefronts appear first in relevant search results.
-  Users can browse dens or see them in search alongside individual listings.
-  Example: Searching “hockey sticks” shows storefronts specializing in hockey gear, then individual listings.

Think of it as your own **personal yard sale**—but online, local, and searchable.

---

### 7. Community-Powered Commerce

DENR aims to revolutionize second-hand commerce by building a **true community** of buyers and sellers. It bridges the gap between yard sales and online shopping, reduces waste, and empowers users to give new life to old goods.

## Additional Features (In Progress)

-  **Sacks:** Unified shopping cart for coordinating multiple purchases and sales in one place.
-  **Delivery Options:** Considering local courier/delivery services for a fee.
-  **Application Process:** Vetted applications for new users.
-  **Profiles:** Rich user profiles and reputation tracking.
-  **Violation Resolution:** Transparent process for handling disputes.
-  **Statuses & Tiers:** Clear user status and tier system.
-  **Guarantees:** Platform guarantees for user safety and satisfaction.
